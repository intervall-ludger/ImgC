# ImgC - Image Optimizer

ImgC is a tool for optimizing images in terms of format and size. It can handle single images or a folder of images and supports the following output formats: **'png'**, **'jpg'**, **'tif'**, and **'pdf'**.

## Installation

To use ImgC, you will need to install the required dependencies listed in the **'requirements.txt'** file:

```basch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use ImgC, run the img.py function with the following arguments:

```basch
python imgc.py -f /path/to/image -s output_suffix [--filter_suffix input_suffix] [--max max_size] [--min min_size]
```

- **-f /path/to/image**: The path to the image file or folder of images to be optimized.
- **-s output_suffix**: The desired output format for the image(s).
- **--filter_suffix input_suffix**: (Optional) The suffix of the input image(s). If not specified, all image types will be processed.
- **--max max_size**: (Optional) The maximum size of the output image(s) in megabytes. If not specified, the size will not be constrained.
- **--min min_size**: (Optional) The minimum size of the output image(s) in megabytes. If not specified, the size will not be constrained.

## Example

To convert all **'jpg'** images in the **'/path/to/images'** folder to **'png'** format with a maximum size of 2 MB and a minimum size of 1 MB, use the following command:

```basch
python imgc.py -f /path/to/images -s png --filter_suffix jpg --max 2 --min 1
```

# Testing the imgc script

To test the functionality of the **imgc** script, you can use the unit tests provided in the **test_imgc.py** file. These tests will verify that the script is able to correctly convert images and apply size constraints.

To run the tests, make sure you have the **unittest** module installed, and then run the following command:

```basch
python -m unittest test_imgc
```
